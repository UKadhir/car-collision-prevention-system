# car-collision-prevention-system
Research Question: Is it possible to create a cheap and effective proximity sensor for a vehicle using an Arduino and distance sensor?  This proposed system would act as a collision prevention system by sounding an alarm if the distance between an object and a vehicle decreases to a dangerous level.
