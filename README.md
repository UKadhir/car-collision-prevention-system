Research Question: Is it possible to create a cheap and effective proximity sensor for a vehicle using an Arduino and distance sensor?  This proposed system would act as a collision prevention system by sounding an alarm if the distance between an object and a vehicle decreases to a dangerous level.
Introduction
In 2021, frontal impacts accounted for 18 driver deaths per million registered passenger vehicles, and these impacts were mostly due to distracted driving [4]. Many of these collisions could have easily been prevent via a warning system. Such a system can give a driver precious seconds to take action and prevent a crash. This is why most new vehicles have a built-in collision prevention system that sounds an alarm if they get too close to whatever is in front of them. In fact, cars produced for the US market after 2018 are required by law to include a backup camera [5]. Unfortunately, older vehicles do not have this warning mechanism built in. To fix this problem, we propose an affordable collision prevention system made of an Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor, and a piezo buzzer that works the same way as that of a newer car for a lower price.
