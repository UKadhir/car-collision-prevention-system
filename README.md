# car-collision-prevention-system
In 2021, frontal impacts accounted for 18 driver deaths per million registered passenger vehicles in the US. However, an onboard digital warning system could have easily prevented many of these collisions. Such a system can give a driver precious seconds to take action and avoid a crash. This is why most new vehicles have a built-in collision prevention system that uses radar to sound an alarm if it gets too close to whatever is in front of them. These systems have been proven to reduce crashes and injuries from forward collisions by about 40%. Unfortunately, older vehicles do not have this warning mechanism built in. To fix this problem, we propose an affordable collision prevention system with an Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor, and a piezo buzzer that works similarly to a newer car.
